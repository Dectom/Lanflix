# Lanflix
Lanflix is a Netflix like application for your LAN. It is developed by the [...]() community.

## Goals
This is a learning and teaching project, it is a place for aspiring developers to practice their skills with like-minded people in an environment that is closer to the real world. The wide range of experience may result in some suboptimal code and some weird technology choices, but we try to make every decision as transparent as possible.
