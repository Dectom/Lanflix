# How to run the project?
```
This documentation helps you run the current setup. It is based on a NodeJS back end, which we haven't settled on yet. This means that the Prerequisites and the way you can run the project may change in the future.
```

## Prerequisites 
To run this project you are required to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) which comes with the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Nodejs is a javascript runtime environment that allows developers to run javascript outside of the browser and access native OS features. NPM provides a way to install and manage 3rd party code we use in the project.  

## Install and Run
1. Clone or fork the project
2. cd Lanflix
3. npm install
4. (sudo) npm install -g nodemon
5. npm start
6. http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3000/playground
